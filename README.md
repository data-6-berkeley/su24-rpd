# Research, Pedagogy, and Discovery Seminar
{: .mb-2 }
UC Berkeley and Tuskegee University
{: .mb-0 .fs-6 .text-grey-dk-000 }

This Summer 2024 Program presents an introductory data science curriculum that integrates research, pedgagogy, and discovery.

There are two parts:
- A 2-week "Coding Bootcamp" that teaches computing topics (without the data) and precedes an introductory data science course such as [Data 6](https://data6.org/). Uses material from [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/), [Data 6](https://data6.org/), and [Data 8](http://data8.org/). Available at `bootcamp`.
- An 8-week Research, Pedagogy, and Discovery Seminar. Available from the top page.
